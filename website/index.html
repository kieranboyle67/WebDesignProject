          <img src= "food/Buddha-Bowl-Sweet-Green-Basil-Dressing-23-2-scaled-e1609762964717.jpg" width=150 alt="bhudda bowl">A buddha bowl is such a tasty option for a quick but healthy and nutritionally balanced dish. There’s such a colorful variety of ingredients you can bring to the table too. The key to bringing it all together is having a delicious yet simple, dressing on hand.This green dressing is one of our favourites and you can whizz it up in a matter of minutes using a hand blender, mini chopper or NutriBullet.. </article><a href="https://www.thetaste.ie/halloumi-quinoa-buddha-bowl-recipe-by-erica-sheehan-of-homespun-2/">click here for recipe</a>

          <h3>Sticky Korean tofu and stir fry kale</h3>
          <img src= "food/tofu.jpg" width=150 alt="tofu">Sticky Korean Tofu & Stir Fry Kale Recipe. If you have never cooked tofu, this recipe is a great tasty introduction! A sticky, sweet, savoury and slightly spiced sauce, serve with the perfect company of kale and sticky rice , just the way we like it! If you have never tried “Gochujang” we promise you are going to love this paste, a Korean red chili paste that is savory, sweet, and spicy, Fermented condiment made from chili powder, glutinous rice, meju powder, yeotgireum, and salt. The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process. If you don’t like chilli just replace it with tomato paste. Perfect light dinner or lunch to pack and go! </article><a href="https://www.thetaste.ie/sticky-korean-tofu-recipe-mynutrition-ireland/">click here for recipe</a>

          <h3>One Pot Wonder</h3>
          <img src= "food/one%20pot.jpeg" width=150 alt="one pot wonder">The very implications of this title fill me with joy. They are easy, quick and there’s absolutely no fighting over the washing up.  One-pot wonders are perfect when the temperature has dropped outside or if indeed you want a wholesome comfort dish and nothing else will do. They can be classed as stews or casseroles and are filling, hearty and satisfying and appeal to most palates. Cooking them slowly over a low gentle heat or in a low oven for a couple of hours till the aromas fill your home is one of most welcoming things you can experience.When cooking stews it’s best to choose a large heavy bottom pot which can withstand long cooking times without burning or food sticking to the pot. The lid should be tight fitting so the liquid does not evaporate whilst cooking. Casserole pots should be ovenproof and also have a tight-fitting lid, I find Le Creuset or cast iron pots are great for all one pot wonders.I find the best way to impart even more flavour to your one-pot wonder is to brown and seal the meat before the slow cooking starts and this applies to poultry and all types of meat. 
This particular chicken recipe is actually great any time of the year.I used chicken thighs in this recipe as they really do add so much flavor especially when they are pan fried initially, browning and crisping the skin. You can use chicken breasts if you prefer leaner meat.  The addition of cream really gives that unctuous richness to this dish but you can use crème fraiche if you prefer.   You can serve this dish with any pasta but I like to serve it with fusilli or tagliatelle or alternatively you can serve it with mashed potato. </article><a href="https://www.thetaste.ie/joy-one-pot-wonder/">click here for recipe</a>

           <h3>Detox Cocktail Drink</h3>
          <img src= "food/detox-cocktails-e1452006768219.jpg" width=150 alt="detoc cocktail">If you are thinking of starting the year clean and healthy… You better detox your body from all the sins that you’ve committed at Christmas! Especially if you’ve overindulged with no restrains and now in the new year you have committed yourself to a healthier lifestyle, we recommend to cleanse your body before dieting, consider changing your nutrition and lifestyle to encourage the elimination of toxins from your body. This can help jump-start a healthy diet, because the build-up of toxins in the body can actually slow down or inhibit fat burning and the absorption of good nutrients and vitamins. Follow a few simple steps to detoxify and cleanse your body before starting a new diet. You better be good with your eating habits while detoxing with these super cocktails as your body will let you know if you’ve being naughty eating too many of the wrong foods.Whether you’re trying to lose weight or you simply want to look and feel healthier, one of the best ways to rid your body of harmful toxins is to drink water. Just 6 to 8 glasses every day will help to keep you hydrated and keep your vital organs in their best possible health.You don’t have to drink plain water, in fact, there are a number of things that you can add to your water that will not only boost the taste, they will help to flush those harmful toxins out of your body. Detox waters have become very popular and there are many different recipes that you can make. We’ve collected many recipes that are best for taste and health benefits, here we share a few to inspire you. These healthy cocktails contain ingredients like lemon which helps to flush harmful toxins from your body, mint which aids in digestion, cucumber which contains anti-inflammatory properties and ginger which is a natural pain reliever and aids in digestion.Some of our cocktails contain other ingredients that are equally as healthy and beneficial. If you have been thinking about adding detox waters to your healthy routine, we have the recipes for you. They are all very simple to make, require very few ingredients and the best part is you can mix and match ingredients to adapt the recipes to your personal taste.We all know the benefits of drinking water, but we’ll be the first to admit we start craving something with a little more flavour. However, being the busy bees we are (we know you are too!), we don’t always have time to whip up something extravagant. To boost our water with some flavourful and healthy kicks, we experimented with different foods and enhancements that can freshen up the water and provide a powerful boost throughout the day. The best part about these DIY “Detox Cocktails” recipes is that they have fabulous cleansing and detoxing properties, and what’s a better time of year to purge your body of toxins than post-Christmas. We hope we can keep you motivated and inspired through the whole year to do small changes that will have a big impact in your health and lifestyle. START YOUR YEAR CLEAN, HEALTHY, ENERGISED AND RADIANT! </article><a href="https://www.thetaste.ie/detox-cocktails-drink-yourself-beautiful/">click here for recipe</a>
