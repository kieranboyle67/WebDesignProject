<h1>Breakfast! The most Important meal of the day...made delicious</h1>
 <main> 
 
     <p>Breakfast is often called ‘the most important meal of the day’, and for good reason. As the name suggests, breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period. It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and alertness, while also providing other essential nutrients required for good health.

Many studies have shown the health benefits of eating breakfast. It improves your energy levels and ability to concentrate in the short term, and can help with better weight management, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease in the long term.

Despite the benefits of breakfast for your health and wellbeing, many people often skip it, for a variety of reasons. The good news is there are plenty of ways to make it easier to fit breakfast into your day.

Why breakfast is so important
When you wake up from your overnight sleep, you may not have eaten for up to 10 hours. Breakfast replenishes the stores of energy and nutrients in your body.

Energy
The body’s energy source is glucose. Glucose is broken down and absorbed from the carbohydrates you eat. The body stores most of its energy as fat. But your body also stores some glucose as glycogen, most of it in your liver, with smaller amounts in your muscles. 

During times of fasting (not eating), such as overnight, the liver breaks down glycogen and releases it into your bloodstream as glucose to keep your blood sugar levels stable. This is especially important for your brain, which relies almost entirely on glucose for energy.

In the morning, after you have gone without food for as long as 12 hours, your glycogen stores are low. Once all of the energy from your glycogen stores is used up, your body starts to break down fatty acids to produce the energy it needs. But without carbohydrate, fatty acids are only partially oxidised, which can reduce your energy levels.

Eating breakfast boosts your energy levels and restores your glycogen levels ready to keep your metabolism up for the day.

Skipping breakfast may seem like a good way to reduce overall energy intake. But research shows that even with a higher intake of energy, breakfast eaters tend to be more physically active in the morning than those who don’t eat until later in the day.</p><a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/HealthyLiving/breakfast">click here for more</a>

     <h3>Full Irish Breakfast</h3>
       <p> <img src= "food/Full-Irish.jpg" width=100 alt="full irish breakfast">
   There is an old motto that says “Eat breakfast like a King, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper”, meaning it is smart to start the day with a full breakfast in your belly to give you sustenance throughout the day. This motto undoubtedly can be applied to the traditional full Irish Breakfast. It is a meal that was traditionally assembled to prepare one for a full day of work on the farm on a cold winter morning. And while opinion may be divided on what is in an Irish breakfast, basically, main ingredients remain the same; bacon, sausages, beans, eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes and potato. They are fried in a little knob of Irish butter and served with a side of soda or brown bread. And the only rule regarding the full breakfast, besides it’s traditional components, is that it must be finished. A Full Irish is like a good book - if you don't see it through to the end, what was the point in starting in the first place?  </p><a href="https://thefeedfeed.com/dianemorrisey/irish-breakfast">click here for recipe</a>

I came up with this recipe after receiving several reader requests for vegetarian breakfast burritos. Each person described a life-changing breakfast burrito ordered at a favorite restaurant. No one mentioned the same restaurant, but all of the burritos had crispy potatoes, eggs, salsa and avocado in common.  </p><a href="https://cookieandkate.com/vegetarian-breakfast-burritos-recipe/">click here for recipe</a>
