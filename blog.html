 <p>Introducing Neven Maguire’s New Blog
Hello there and welcome to the First 1,000 Days blog. I will be making regular posts to this blog over the coming year so be sure to check back for all the latest news and updates on the First 1,000 Days movement. My wife, Amelda, will also be posting during the year and we hope you’ll enjoy the content and find it a useful read.

As an Irish chef, I believe that one of life’s simple pleasures is sharing great food with our families. This has become all the more relevant to me as a father with a young family. I feel it’s never too early to extend the joy of food and sharing fantastic meals with our children.

I’ve always been aware of the importance of nutrition but since joining forces with Danone Baby Nutrition on this campaign, I’ve learnt so much about the importance of the First 1,000 Days in ensuring the successful development of a child’s health and in the long term, ensuring they are afforded the best nutritional options. I now truly understand how important nutrition is, especially at this formative time of life.

As a dad, I get huge satisfaction from watching the twins’ tastes evolve. It is so important that children are exposed to a wide range of foods, tastes and flavours at an early age. Not only will this allow them to become familiar with different foods and flavours, it will also ensure that their taste buds develop. What you eat matters! Introducing nutrient-rich foods and flavours to children at a young age will ensure they progress and develop suitably, but it’ll also ensure they adopt lifelong habits that’ll benefit them as they get older.

My wife and I know how hard it can be for families with young children to consistently provide the best nutrition. Given the many demands on parents’ time it is sometimes tempting to take the easy option, however providing optimum nutrition throughout the first 1,000 days doesn’t have to be difficult.

Your ‘First 1,000 Days Recipe Book’ contains lots of simple, delicious and nutritious recipes made with the best of Irish ingredients; I have contributed some of our family favourites in the recipe booklet. They are all tried and tested so I can speak from experience when I say they go down a treat! We also have recipes from other well-known nutritionists so be sure to check those out also.

Our aim is simple; we want to support you in providing healthy nutrition for all of your family, right from the start. On a final note, I only hope you enjoy them as much as our family has. Until next time, happy cooking!</p><a href="https://www.first1000days.ie/introducing-neven-maguires-new-blog-2/">The following is an abstract from the following website click link for more details</a>
